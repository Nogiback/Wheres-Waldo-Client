# Wheres-Waldo-Client

[NodeJS - Where's Waldo Project - The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app)

This is one of the final projects under the Fullstack Javascript Development curriculum for The Odin Project. The purpose of this project was to clone the popular book/game series, Where's Waldo. The application allow users to pick a level and find all the hidden characters. Upon finishing, the user can enter their username to save their time/highscore to the leaderboard.

This repository is for the client side of the application.

## Lessons Learned

This project was another opportunity to strengthen my experience with the Full Stack process. On the client side, this was a great opportunity to go more in depth with asynchronous REST API calls, using React hooks, and how to manipulate the DOM to flesh out the user interactions for the game. This was also another opportunity to really get to know Typescript. I learned a lot about setting up types building the game from the ground up.
